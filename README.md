# PiedraPapelTijeraLagartoSpock
A small version of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock with a cute WPF frontend, for a very informal educational purpose with a few unit tests and a couple patterns applied

There are a few spanish words all over the project, but I think all you should know to understand the code itself is:

Piedra = Rock
Papel = Paper
Tijera = Scissors
Lagarto = Lizard
